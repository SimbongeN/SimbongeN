I'm a passionate computer science student entering my second year at University of Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa, majoring in computer science. I love diving into the world of code and building exciting projects. In my free time, you'll find me exploring the realms of ethical hacking through CTF games like [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/), where I hone my skills and learn by doing.
